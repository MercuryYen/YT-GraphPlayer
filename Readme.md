# YT-GraphPlayer

YT-GraphPlayer is a web-based playlist player designed to manage YouTube videos and playlists in a more organized way. It allows you to add a playlist within a playlist, store all videos and playlists in a single page, and simplifies navigation by reducing browser clutter when handling many videos.

## Features

-   **Nested Playlists**: Add playlists within playlists, creating an organized hierarchy of video collections.
-   **Single Page Management**: Store all videos and playlists on one page for easy access and control.
-   **Simplified Browsing**: Eliminates the complexity of managing multiple tabs or windows for various YouTube videos, keeping everything in one place.

## Setup

No installation is required for YT-GraphPlayer. This project is a simple HTML and JavaScript-based tool that runs directly in your browser.

### How to Use:

1. Open the web page via the **Deployments** link on GitHub.
2. Enter YouTube video URLs to add them to your playlist.
3. Organize videos and playlists with drag-and-drop functionality, and use branching to control how videos play.
4. Store and manage all your videos without needing multiple browser tabs.

## Compatibility

YT-GraphPlayer is fully compatible with all modern browsers. Since it only uses HTML and JavaScript, there are no browser-specific features or limitations.

## Contributing

All contributions are welcome! Whether you want to add new features, optimize the UI, or fork the project, feel free to create a pull request. The only rule is to maintain **compatibility**. Avoid using overly complex or browser-specific features that could break functionality across different platforms.
